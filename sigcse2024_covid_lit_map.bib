abstract = {In 2020, the world confronted an unprecedented event affecting education globally: COVID-19. Events that disrupt education are not new; Homelessness or trauma negatively impact education at an individual level, whereas war stops education completely. This event is unique in that it caused the cessation of in-person instruction for all but with a rapid transition to remote instruction. In this study, we explore how the COVID-19 pandemic affected instruction of Scratch Encore Curriculum, a Scratch curriculum typically used in middle grades with students between 10-14 years old. We analyzed a variety of data sources, including partner classroom-level data as well as anonymous download data. We found that instruction halted abruptly in the United States at the beginning of the March lockdown, with no further instruction that spring. With the introduction of online instructional materials, instruction resumed to normal levels during the 2020-21 school year (which was remote instruction for much of the year). In addition, students completed projects with similar accuracy and completeness during remote instruction as compared with in-person instruction prior to the pandemic.},

abstract = {This paper presents the findings from a research project exploring the impact of learner resilience as part of the shift to online delivery of learning, teaching and assessment amidst national "lockdown" measures as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. This exploration of resilience was undertaken as part of the delivery of a first-year undergraduate computer science degree programme in a UK higher education institution over two academic years. Resilience was measured by the Nicholson McBride Resilience Questionnaire (NMRQ). The responses from the 2019-2020 and 2020-2021 student cohorts (N=214) illustrate that overall learner resilience as measured by NMRQ does not appear to have had a significant impact upon learner success as measured by the mean overall first-year performance. This is an outcome that differs from previous work and may be a consequence of the disruptive (and ongoing) circumstances arising from the pandemic. However, this work identifies that the factor "I try to control events rather than being a victim of my circumstances" appears to promote success and the factor "I trust my intuition" may have been slightly detrimental to overall success. As we start to consider the post-pandemic new (ab)normal, learners will continue to face significant personal challenges that will impact upon their engagement with their studies and their performance and progression; thus the insights offered from this UK university study can help to inform emerging academic and pastoral practice for undergraduate computer science education.},

abstract = {As enrollments in computing courses have surged, the ratio of students to faculty has risen at many institutions. Along with many other large undergraduate programs, our institution has adapted to this challenge by hiring increasing numbers of undergraduate tutors to help students. In early computing courses, their role at our institution is primarily to help students with their programming assignments. Despite our institution offering a training course for tutors, we are concerned about the quality and nature of these student-tutor interactions. As instruction moved online due to COVID-19, this provided the unique opportunity to record all student-tutor interactions (among consenting participants) for research. In order to gain an understanding of the behaviors common in these interactions, we conducted an initial qualitative analysis using open coding followed by a quantitative analysis on those codes. Overall, we found that students are not generally receiving the instruction we might hope or expect from these sessions. Notably, tutors often simply give students the solution to the problem in their code without teaching them about the process of finding and correcting their own errors. These findings highlight the importance of tutoring sessions for learning in introductory courses and motivate remediation to make these sessions more productive.},

abstract = {The outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic gave rise to a need to change course syllabi in order to completely transition to a remote learning model. In the case of subjects comprising programming tasks, taking into account the availability of tools and resources that provide opportunities for independent work without teacher supervision, it was necessary to decide whether students should be allowed to work under self-paced learning, or, similar to traditional classes, fixed-schedule learning. Experiences from MOOCs demonstrated that course scheduling is not without impact on the learning process, and may affect the level of student satisfaction with the course. This study determines how course scheduling affected the performance of students attending a database course. The students were divided into two groups, and completed the first module without teacher supervision. During the learning process, they solved programming tasks which were assessed automatically, and then took quizzes to verify what they learned. One of the groups worked with the materials and took the quizzes in accordance with a schedule, and the other group did so without any time constraints. The results demonstrate that students perform better when working under the fixed-schedule model, without any impact on their level of satisfaction with the course. The system of learning not only affected the quiz results in the module where different scheduling was used, but student performance in later parts of the course as well. The results presented in the paper should be of interest to teachers designing remote courses involving self-learning.},

abstract = {The global COVID-19 pandemic resulted in education being shifted online, including in developing countries. Developing countries frequently have lower levels of Internet penetration than developed countries. Thus, one of the fears with the transition to online education was that students would be disenfranchised. At one university in a developing country the institution's learning management system (LMS) logs all user (students and faculty) activity. Using these logs we study how student activity in an undergraduate computer networking course has evolved in three offerings--two from the 2018/19 and 2019/20 academic years before the pandemic and the other from the 2020/21 year during the pandemic. The data show that the average number of LMS transactions per student went up during the COVID pandemic compared to the number prior to the pandemic. While this finding is not unexpected, given that students were being instructed online, other data from the logs points to some interesting trends. For example, there is a statistically significant difference in the number of clicks on embedded URLs within the LMS across the years. Other data show that students did not attend lectures or tutorials (discussion sections) as much as expected, and that the number of students "attending'' online class sessions declined over the course of the semester. We provide reasons for these trends.},

As grades in introductory computer science courses tend to be lower than other courses, it is essential to provide students with contextualized feedback about their performance in these courses. Giving students unambiguous and con- textualized feedback is especially important during COVID when many classes have moved online and instructors and students have fewer opportunities to interact. In this study, we investigate the effect of a lightweight, scalable intervention where students received personalized, contextualized feedback from their instructors after two major assignments during the semester. After each intervention, we collected survey data to assess students' self-assessment of computing ability, sense of belonging, intentions to persist in computing, professional role confidence, and the likelihood of stating intention to pursue a major in computer science. To analyze the effectiveness of our intervention, we conducted linear regression and mediation analysis on student survey responses. Our results have shown that providing students with personalized feedback can significantly improve their self-assessment of computing ability, which will significantly improve their intentions to persist in computing. Furthermore, our results have demonstrated that our intervention can significantly improve students' sense of belonging, professional role confidence, and the likelihood of stating an intention to pursue a major in computer science.},

abstract = {Due to the pandemic of COVID-19, many university courses had to abruptly transform to enable remote teaching. Adjusting courses on embedded systems and micro-controllers was extra challenging since interaction with real hardware is their integral part. We start by comparing our experience with four basic alternatives of teaching embedded systems: 1) interacting with hardware at school, 2) having remote access to hardware, 3) lending hardware to students for at-home work and 4) virtualizing hardware. Afterward, we evaluate in detail our experience of the fast transition from traditional, offline at-school hardware programming course to using remote access to real hardware present in the lab. The somewhat unusual remote hardware access approach turned out to be a fully viable alternative for teaching embedded systems, enabling a relatively low-effort transition. Our setup is based on existing solutions and stable open technologies without the need for custom-developed applications that require high maintenance. We evaluate the experience of both the students and teachers and condense takeaways for future courses. The specific environment setup is available online as an inspiration for others.},

This experience report presents CompSciConnect (CSC), a multi-year program designed to broaden participation in computing for middle school aged students from historically excluded populations (girls and/or Black, Latina/o/e/x, and Native American [BLNA] students). Each cohort of CSC participants span three years with participants meeting for 2 weeks in the summer and one weekend a month during the school year. Students progress through three levels of the program: Yellow (beginner), Red (intermediate), and Terp (advanced). Quantitative and qualitative data guided the growth and implementation of CSC. CSC began in 2012 with just 14 students and now has reached over 532 students. Additionally, CSC alumni cite their experiences in CSC as contributing to their decisions to major in a computing field. Various design factors-such as community-centered student recruitment strategies, the long-term structure of the program, and the scaffolded curriculum-contributed to CSC's growth and its positive impact on CSC participants. In this paper, we present CSC, elaborate on the design factors that led to CSC's success, and highlight the challenges and lessons learned throughout CSC's development.},

abstract = {The Peer-Led Team Learning (PLTL) teaching model has been widely applied in several four-year institutions in STEM areas, including Computer Science. Although only a few two-year colleges have adopted similar teaching models, the number of contact hours and interaction between peer leaders and students are limited, and the implementation of an authentic PLTL model is constrained by students' schedules and location accommodation. The propelled migration from face-to-face to online classes during the COVID-19 pandemic surfaced dissemination and implementation of such model alternative. The PLTL model was implemented for the fundamentals of Computer Science, i.e., CS 1, 2, and 3, where peer leaders learned pedagogical techniques, designed, implemented, and proctored programming activities for the three courses online. In this paper, we report the experience of the PLTL model applied to a computer science program in a community college. Experience includes the peer leaders' growth in disseminating material to their peers and how this model measures course performance, recruitment, retention, and completion.},

abstract = {Due to the Covid-19 pandemic, most university classes were moved to online instruction. This greatly stimulated the need for online learning tools. WeBWorK is an open source online homework system, which has been used extensively in a variety of subjects. However, it has not been widely adopted by the Computer Science education community. In this paper, we discuss our experience using WeBWorK in teaching two large online sections of discrete mathematics. Emphasis is given to how we created randomized and auto-graded problems for many topics. In addition, we summarize student performance and feedback. We conclude with our reflections on using WeBWorK and propose future work for exploring its adaptive learning features.},

abstract = {Students have experienced incredible shifts in their learning environments, brought about by the response of universities to the ever-changing public health mandates driven by waves and stages of the coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19). Initially, these shifts in learning (mode of course delivery, course availability, etc.) were considered emergency responses. However, as the pandemic pressed on, students have had to repeatedly adapt to the continuously evolving educational landscape. This working group builds upon foundations and structure created by a 2021 ITiCSE Working Group exploring the effects of COVID-19 on teaching and learning from a faculty perspective. That working group identified the incorporation of some pandemic-induced changes into future teaching practices. This working group examines the existing literature and insights gained from responses to a multi-national survey to explore the new student experience emerging from the continuously evolving teaching practices catalyzed by the global pandemic. Traditionally, computing is a subject full of experiential learning opportunities, rich with in-person labs and exercises. We investigate how the changes within the COVID-affected academic landscape have altered that student experience. The current group of computing students will have had experiences under both typical (i.e. pre-pandemic) and COVID-affected teaching practices. It is, therefore, timely that we understand how each has impacted how they perceive their learning environment and educational experience. In turn, identifying those practices that have most benefited the student learning experience will help computing faculty improve their educational methods going forward.},
